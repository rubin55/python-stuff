# A collection of various things in Python

This is my Python experiments and other things repository. You'll find various directories with Python source code in them and invariably a `requirements.txt` file. You can work with the code in the relevant subdirectory by creating a Python virtual environment and installing the requirements:

    python -m venv venv
    pip install -r <dir>/requirements.txt
    python something.py
